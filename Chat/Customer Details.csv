Richarda,Millera,9912881123,Long story - I placed an order 6468609 back at the end of Sept.  After it was shipped I realized it was being shipped to my old address and could not change it.  since it was sent via UPS Sure Post I called my old post office and they said that since I still had the mail forward on it should get to my new address (10 miles away).  Clearly something went wrong with the forward since it was sent to 4 different states.  It ended up back at my old post office where I called again and they indicated that they would get the forward correct this time but it appears that instead they sent it back to Dodgeville WI.  Can you please help me get my package back?
Jasona,Skariaa,9912881124,I am a regular customer at Lands End UK but have bought clothes also from US as there seems to be much bigger and better selection there. However my recent purchase in October was quite a nightmare in that there was a problem with Borderfree - and making an order and I have already discussed it with you. On 23rd November I ordered (or thought I had ordered and paid for) a large sized sweater fleece roll brim hat and scarf. however I went in to check my emails to get confirmation and found that the order never went through! I went in to try again and found that the large size in the hat is unavailable. It is so frustrating shopping on Landsend.com!

They then went on sale and a promo went out which would have saved about $7 per boot. I was one day past the 14 day adjustment period but i was told that it would likely be approved and to watch my statement.  I explained that if it was not going to be approved I would reorder the boots and return the other ones but the LE agent said not to bother.  can you confirm whether it was OK'd or not?  name is sharon bowler zip 06477 two pairs kids snow flurry boots in clover flower and prussian blue. thanks.

Zoea,Mirfakhraiea,9912881146,Hi there - my father in law bought my two kids (ages 34) your bean bags last year for christmas last year.  SO they have used them for the past 9 months.  I started noticing small white stuff all over my floor about a month ago and didnt think anything of it but them my 3 year old unzipped her bag and the inside insert was completely gone and all beads were loose.  My four year old son has autism and started to put the beads in his mouth.  I am so upset with these bean bags.  DO you guys have a policy about this because the outside covers were personalized and are beautiful but the inside is worthless?  My family and I buy a lot of things from you and I am just so ffrustrated with the quality of these inserts - HELP!!

Prakasha,Venkataramanana,9912881400,"Hello. I recently purchased the Expedition ""Parka"" as part of a recent order (# 34069694). It is an excellent coat. I was debating betweem the park and the coat and decided that the parka would be more appropriate for my use. However I think (based on the photos on your website) that you sent me the coat. I ordered an XL-Tall. I'm 6'3"" and the coat comes down to 4"" above my knee. That's the coat correct? The plastic bag it came is does say parka. It looks like the coat was mis-bagged. Now that I have the coat (and especially with this weather) the coat is the right choice (so thank you). The reason I am writing is because the coat costs $50 less than the parka. I'm about to place another order with you (leather/cashmere gloves & alpaca scarf) and it would be really nice to apply a $50 credit to my next order. If you would like proof I can send you a photo of me in the coat. How do we proceed with this?"

JUNa,PANa,9912881567,Good evening. I've been wanting to buy the Women's Plus Size PETITE Milano Rib Jacket in 14W for a while now. Today I finally came to do it and it seems teh 14WP may never have existed. (I ordered the 16P months ago and the fit was a bit narrow whilst the 16WP is sure to have too much fabric around the waist and shoulders making it look rather sloppy.) A while back an LE Rep located an item for me that appeared unavailable on-line (I think it was due to very low quantity. I pray that is the case today.) Would it be possible for you to check to see if this jacket is available in size Petite 14W in the Blue Grass color? Pretty please. Item # 422717-WQX. It would be greatly appreciated.

Paula,Lunta,9912881573,I bought a Lands end down jacket last January. The jacket was nice and warm outside but terribly warm when I entered a store and I am usually cold. My last Lands end jacket was great- it was warm outside but I was never sweating in it when entering a store. It became very uncomfortable to stop at a store while wearing the new jacket- it was just too heavy both to wear inside or to carry around the store. I realized that I had to buy another jacket but it was rather late in the season at that time making it hard to find one. I've been reading your guarantee policy and wanted to know how this jacket can be returned since I am rather disappointed in it.

However I have the world's fattest left upper arm.  I currently own a short-sleeved mesh polo shirt size 2X and I don't wear it because it is too tight around my left arm (but of course too big everywhere else!).  Where can I find out the circumference of the upper arm of a long-sleeved Pima Polo and a long-sleeved Mesh Polo in 2X?

Hutcha,Douglasa,9912881651,"Hi. I shop Lands End quite a lot. I wanted to offer some what I hope is constructive feedback that you could share with the business office. I do not like that Lands End now uses the US Postal Service for deliveries. I have experienced problems when the USPS is used for the last leg of the delivery but I never have problems when it's UPS that is completing the delivery. For example I am awaiting order number 4864636. The tracking info tells me that USPS ""attempted delivery"" to a business address at 6:29 p.m. on a Friday in August. That is ridiculous. Of course no one was at the office and now a ""re-delivery attempt"" will apparently take place. Why would USPS even try to deliver to a business so late in the day? It is maddening.

Biswanatha,Basua,9912881728,I received a pair of the Women's Classic Stud Earrings in silver (item #426967-AGX) for Christmas and after wearing them twice with no problem I was no longer able to get the post through the back it would get stuck halfway in. I wore them once like this with no issue but the next time I wore them the earring came loose from the back and fell out of my ear but I have no idea where it fell out and it is now lost. I'm incredibly frustrated as I thought this would be a good high-quality item from LE and I'm surprised at the shoddiness of this jewelry. Would you please consider replacing these earrings since it was the backing that failed and caused the earring to be lost?

Paula,Quagliaa,9912881910,I purchased a really nice winter coat a few years ago from lands end. Wore it off and on. It is still in excellent shape except for a very big problem the zipper busted. It shouldn't have. I have not been able to wear  it at all this season because of this. I checked into getting the zipper replaced but because of the way the coat is designed not a simple fix and cost doesn't make sense to do it. I would like to return coat and either have you folks fix bu or replace it or refund for a new coat. I have been buying Lands end coat's for years now for not only for myself but my entire family. Satisfied up until this point. Very disappointed I really liked this coat. Not happy that I can't use it.

Ellena,Nelsona,9912884158,I stopped at the Land's End department at Sears in Plantation FL on Sunday (09-29-13).  The department is unstaffed there is no one in the store to help with sizes or to help you order online and there were no signs posted indicating the 30% Friends and Family discount.  I will place my order online instead.    I find this unusual since I also shop at the Boca Raton location where the Lands End department is near fitting rooms has staff and is very helpful.    Living in South Florida and originally from the Midwest I find the selection very limited in the stores.

Willa,Canesa,9912884795,"HI.  I ordered...123779100.  We have ordered sheets in the past and they were fine.  I thought a California King would be larger than the King.  Recently we purchased a new bed which is a King.  However it is very thick and the older sheets do not fit as well...due to the bed being larger...(Thicker).  Looks like the California King is actually smaller than the regular King.  In Canada they have a ""King"" and I believe another they call a ""Super King"".  The Super King is made to cover the larger size King...hope this is making sense."

She needs much more support than other girls her age I think that a bikini with a bra top might be a better choice for her.
